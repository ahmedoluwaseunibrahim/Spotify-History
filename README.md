## Project Overview 
This project is the data analysis of spotify streaming history from 2014-2024,The analysis is performed using the powerbi tools to provide insights and valuable decisions with the aim of creative an effective dadaset. 

## Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of analysis for the dataset is to understand userâ€™s behaviour,arist songs and albums streams and identify them.

## Data Source 
The dataset  sourced for this project is from maven analytics [website](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground) designed for practice purposeIt is presented in powerbi file with three tables (artist and tack table,streams table and playtime table) 
with 3586 rows and 6,2,2,5 and 14 columns respectively.The dataset has key attributes for analysis  
such as (Track name, Artist name,Album name, Minutes played, Timestamp, Platform. 

## Data Preparation and Cleaning 
 
Preparation and cleaning of data is important and paramount to analysing the dataset accurately, 
and error free to deliver a very informative analysis making sur of no duplicate from the columns,checking for errors in the row and made sure the data was accurate,although spotify is a very broad streaming app world wide i chose what i could work with and left out  others from the dataset. 
 
### Steps taking taking in creating the dataset: 
- USE OF STAR SCHEMA 
 
The use of star schema was very important to the dataset as spotify history is a single table data structure which means the star schema helps in building relationships by creatle dimension tables out 
of the fact table that already exist as spotify history,here are fact table from spotify history 
                e.g  (album_name,track_name,artist_name,minutes 
                      played,timestamp,spotify_track_uri,skipped,shuffled,reason_start,reason_end). 
Those exist in fact table so i create dimesion table from duplicating fact table and editing each dimension to what i want to work with in the fact table.created table below 
 
  #### Dimension Table:
  - **Artist Dimension:** unique artist with attributes like artist name,artistID is created so i 
                                deleted all columns from the duplicate and left the two above.   
   - **Platform dimension:** platform name,platformID is created so i deleted all columns 
                               spotify history 
 
  - **Track Dimension:**  it has a different approach as the unique column for  
                            spotify_track_uri,which is a tracker in the fact table and also a link in the dimension  
                            simply means it would be in both tables with the album name,artist name,track  
                            name.the remaining duplicate columns will be  deleted and trackID  created 
                            and would serve as the main link to the fact table 
                                    
 - **Time Dimension:**  the timestamp on fact table is duplicated to create time 
                                     dimension after deleting duplicates and cleaning up,columns are created such 
                                      are:year,month,day of the week,time of day,they relate with the fact table.

## Visualizations, Insights and Findings 
- The visual,insight and findings of dataset for playtime by album and artist by minutes which the chart type is a matrix to describe playtime by minutes for the  artist and the album , it will show playtime per album per artist.

- Platform playtime by platform is the sum of minutes played by platforms,with the findings, it is observed that android platform has the most playtime while web player has the least playtime.the dax measure is Platform Playtime = SUM('spotify_History'[ms_played]).

 - The visual for the dataset analysis with measures created to get streams by hour by time of day,illustrated with a pie chart below indicates time of day as morning,afternoon and night with the visuals showing streams in the morning as the highest percentage with 50.78%, night having 33.44% while afternoon having the least streams by hour with 15.78%. The dax measure for the chart value is   Streams By Hour = COUNTROWS(Spotify_History) using time of day to create the visuals. 
With my observation,i discovered that morning is when most listeners stream the most and afternoon is the least based on hours by time of day.

- skipped status is the a measure used to find out which tracks are skipped in the dataset

## Recommendations 

 
Based on the analysis,the recommendation for  spotify streaming history 
 
- improve on the platform with lesser playtime to give the company a balanced audience 
 

- ensure to create a playlist for listenig ours and time of day to have an algorithm and competition  
 
- monitor artist albums and tracks to avoid botting and fraudulent streams.


## Conclusion 
 
my recommendation to spotify can innovate and create awareness of how to care for listers more and always improve . 
 
Thank you you for attention. 
 
I am interested in becoming a data analyst in an organization where i can improve and showcase my skills and knowledge and help the company to greater height.
